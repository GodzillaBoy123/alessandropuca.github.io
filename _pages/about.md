Plant pathologist with a dual PhD in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (DAGRI, University of Florence & LVBE, Université de Haute-Alsace). Expertise in molecular techniques (qPCR, digital PCR, LAMP), expecially for invasive species detection. Knowleadgeable about fungal wood degradation processes.

Currently a Research Fellow at CNR-IPSP (Florence), where I am involved in the 1LIVEXylella project. In my work I'm tasked with the development and validation of protocols and technologies for the ultrasensitive detection of Xylella fastidiosa in both plant tissues and insect vectors. I'm also involved in many other projects on forest pathogens detection.

Most importantly, I'm very good at making pies
